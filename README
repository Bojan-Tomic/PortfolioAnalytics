This V2.1 version of PortfolioAnalytics is an update to the substantial V2.0
version that was released on 2024-07-03. We first describe the V2.0 features,
then discuss the R demo capability, and finally we describe the additional
V2.1 features.

# 2.0 Features

A major feature of 2.0 is the integration of the CVXR solver R package
for convex optimization. CVXR supports eleven solver packages, each of
which supports solvers for one or more of the following optimization 
problems: LP, QP, SOCP, SDP, EXP, MIP. See the Table near the beginning
of the document "Convex Optimization in R" at https://cvxr.rbind.io/. 
Thus, with PortfolioAnalytics 2.0, users are able to use any one of a 
variety of solvers available in CVXR for their portfolio optimization
problems.

A particular use of CVXR in PortfolioAnalytics 2.0 is for computing Minimum
Coherent Second Moment (MinCSM) portfolios, which are second-order cone
programming (SOCP) optimization problems. This is quite a new capability
that  is not available in other portfolio optimization software products.
Details are provided in the Vignette "cvxrPortfolioAnalytics".

Another important feature of PortfolioAnalytics 2.0, is that it contains 
functionality for computing outliers-robust minimum variance (MV) optimal
portfolios based on any one of several robust covariance matrix estimators
that are not much influenced by outliers  Details are provided in the Vignette
"robustCovMatForPA".

New PortfolioAnalytics 2.0 Functions:

1. meancsm.efficient.frontier (create Mean-CSM efficient frontier) utility function
2. meanrisk.efficient.frontier (generate multiple efficient frontiers for portfolios with the same constraint object.
3. extract_risk (extract the risk value, e.g., StdDev or ES or CSM, based on the weights of a portfolio)
4. chart.EfficientFrontierCompare (Overlay the efficient frontiers of different minRisk portfolio objects on a single plot)
5. backtest.plot (generate plots of the cumulative returns and/or drawdown for back-testing)
6. opt.outputMvo (converts output of `optimize.portfolio` to a list of the portfolio weights, mean, volatility and Sharpe Ratio)
7. plotFrontiers (plot frontiers based on the result of `meanvar.efficient.frontier`, `meanetl.efficient.frontier` or `meancsm.efficient.frontier`)


Enhanced PortfolioAnalytics Functions:

1. optimize.portfolio (enhanced with CVXR solvers, CSM objective, customizable argument `momentFUN=` and output `~$moment_values`)
2. optimize.portfolio.rebalancing (enhanced with CVXR solvers, CSM objective and customizable arg `momentFUN=`)
3. create.EfficientFrontier (enhanced with type `mean-CSM` and `mean-risk`, and customizable arg `momentFUN=`)


Support S3 Methods for CVXR:

1. print.optimize.portfolio.CVXR
2. extractStats.optimize.portfolio.CVXR


Custom Moment Functions for Robust Covariance Matrices:

1. custom.covRob.MM
2. custom.covRob.Rocke
3. custom.covRob.Mcd
4. custom.covRob.TSGS
5. MycovRobMcd
6. MycovRobTSGS
 

Two New Vignettes:

1. cvxrPortfolioAnalytics: CRAN title = "CVXR for PortfolioAnalytics".
2. demo_cvxrPortfolioAnalytics.R
3. robustCovMatForPA: CRAN title = "Robust Covariance Matrices for PortfolioAnalytics"
4. demo_robustCovMatForPA.R

# PortfolioAnalytics Demo Scripts

Prior to the PortfolioAnalytics 2.0 release, the demo folder contained 31
R scripts.  You can view the names and function of R scripts in the demo
in the demo folder (if it exists and is not empty) of any R package with
the function demo(package = "packageName").  

For example use of demo(package = "PortfolioAnalytics")

# Bug Reportin

Please contribute with bug fixes, comments, and testing scripts! 

Please take your data and disguise it when submitting, or use data sets like 
"edhec" like we do in the demos or or like "stocksCRSP" and "factorsSPGMI" in 
the PCRA package or with your constraints and other objectives modified to 
demonstrate your problem on public data.

Please report any bugs or issues on the PortfolioAnalytics GitHub page at
https://github.com/braverock/PortfolioAnalytics/issues

# Acknowledgements

The bulk of the work in creating PortfolioAnalytics 2.0 was done by Xinran Zhao, 
along with contributions from Yifu Kang, under the support of a 2022 Google 
Summer of Code (GSOC 2022). Xinran and Yifu were mentored in GSOC 2022 by 
Professor Doug Martin and Professor Steve Murray in the Applied Mathematics 
Department at the University of Washington.
